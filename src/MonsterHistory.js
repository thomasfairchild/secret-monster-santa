        <h1>MONSTERS & HISTORY</h1>

        <h2><span>Throughout history, monsters have been there with us every step of the way, 
        from lurking in the shadows to haunting our wildest imaginations. Speaking of
        imaginations, the human brain is capable of imagining all kinds of things -- including
        things that are not what they seem.</span></h2>

        <h2><span>What is a monster? The colloquial meaning of monster is imaginary creature, 
            cruel person, or an out-of-control child (as a father of a toddler I can attest to this).
            But did you know monster was originally called monstrum, which in Latin means
            a sign or warning? In most story depictions, monsters are a clear and present danger, 
            but why is that? And what important lessons can we learn so that we too don't become monsters and history
            doesn't repeat itself?</span></h2>
