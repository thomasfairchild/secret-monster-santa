    <h1>THE MOVIE</h1>
    <h2><span>Originally made in December 2018, Secret Monster Santa has been
    newly remastered just in time to greet the New Year. Filmed on a miniature green screen set, these highly-detailed and articulate figurines were brought to life
    using the stop motion method. In post-production, Adobe After Effects brought glad tidings of movie magic joy. Secret Monster Santa remains a personal favorite 
    of mine as it invites the viewer to look past the monstrous appearances of the cast and instead see the good-natured being within.
